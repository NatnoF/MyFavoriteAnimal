                <h3>Grizzly Bears</h3>
                <p>
                    The grizzly bear is a kind of brown bear. Many people in North America use the common name “grizzly
                    bear” to refer to the smaller and lighter-colored bear that occurs in interior areas and the term
                    “brown bear” to refer to the larger and typically darker-colored bear in coastal areas. However,
                    most of these bears are now considered the same subspecies.

                <h3>Polar Bears</h3>
                <p>
                    The largest bear in the world and the Arctic's top predator, polar bears are a powerful symbol of the strength and endurance of the Arctic. The polar bear's Latin name, Ursus maritimus, means "sea bear." It's an apt name for this majestic species, which spends much of its life in, around, or on the ocean–predominantly on the sea ice. In the United States, Alaska is home to two polar bear subpopulations.
